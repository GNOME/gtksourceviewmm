Building gtksourceviewmm-3.0 with Visual Studio 2015 or later

* You will need Visual Studio 2015 (MSVC 14.0) or later. Earlier versions of the compiler, including 12.0
  and earlier will not work.  The build can be carried out using the NMake Makefiles supplied in this
  directory.  You will also need to hand-edit $(srcroot)\gtksourceview\gtksourceviewmmconfig.h.in and save
  it as $(srcroot)\gtksourceview\gtksourceviewmmconfig.h, by changing the lines starting with #undef to
  reflect the actual version that you are building and on whether to allow building and using deprecated
  items.  Alternatively, if you have a PERL interpreter installed and it is in your PATH, the build
  process will handle this editing for you.
* Install the latest Win32 GTK+ Development files from ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+,
  and build gtksourceview-3.18.0 or later
* Build libsigc++, glibmm, cairomm atkmm and pangomm from source, with the same compiler version, even if
  on Visual Studio 2015, 2017 or 2019.  If there are strange linker or runtime errors, they are likely
  caused by mixing different compiler versions.
* Use the Visual Studio command prompt that is appropriate for your build and navigate to this directory.
* Run nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=[debug|release].  Also pass in PREFIX=<path> to this command line if
  gtksourceview, libsigc++, glibmm, cairomm, atkmm, pangomm and gtkmm are not in
  $(srcroot)\..\vs[14|15|16]\$(platform).
  Note that vs14 stands for Visual Studio 2015 and vs15 stands for Visual Studio 2017 and vs16 stands for
  Visual Studio 2019.
* Build the tests by appending 'tests' to the NMake command line in the previous step.
