0.1.0:

* Initial release of libgtksourceviewmm 0.1.0

* This is a fork of gtksourceviewmm 1.10.0 .
  It has been totally rewritten to integrate well in the gtkmm environment.

* all the APIs of gtksourceview 1.6.2 are wrapped.

* users that used to use gtksourceviewmm from the svn repository must now
  update their configure.[in|ac] to check against libgtksourceviewmm-1.0, version 0.1.0.
  The former check was against gtksourceviewmm-1.0 (there was no 'lib' prefix),  version 1.10.0.
  I decided to change the name of the project to be able to set the project's version to a number < 1.0,
  whereas the initial gtksourceviewmm project current version was 1.10.0. To me, version > 1.0 implies
  a certain level of maturity and libgtksourceviewmm is too young to commit on that.
