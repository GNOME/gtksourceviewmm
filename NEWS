0.3.0

    [Dodji Seketeli]

    * updated API documentation
    * added gtksourceview/gtksourceviewmm.h as a shortcut header to include
      all the gtksourviewmm headers.
    * wrapped the GtkSourceIter class.

    [Murray Cumming]

    * various API cleanless fixes. Added needed const to various getters.
    * cleaned documentation make install process

    [Johannes Schmid]

    * fixed a typo. Renamed SourceBuffer::end_notundoable_action() into
     SourceBuffer::end_not_undoable_action().


0.2.0:

This is a bugfix release that breaks the API a little bit.
Users of 0.1.0 must recompile their applications, sorry.

* added a create() method to gtksourceview::SourceLanguage
  and gtksourceview::SourceLanguagesManager . Made the constructor
  of gtksourceview::SourceLanguagesManager protected, cleanup. [Murray Cumming]

* set the argument of set_*(bool) methods to 'true' by default [Dodji Seketeli]

0.1.0:

* Initial release of libgtksourceviewmm 0.1.0

* This is a fork of gtksourceviewmm 1.10.0 .
  It has been totally rewritten to integrate well in the gtkmm environment.

* all the APIs of gtksourceview 1.6.2 are wrapped.

* users who used to use gtksourceviewmm from the svn repository must now
  update their configure.[in|ac] to check against libgtksourceviewmm-1.0, version 0.1.0.
  The former check was against gtksourceviewmm-1.0 (there was no 'lib' prefix),  version 1.10.0.
  I decided to change the name of the project to be able to set the project's version to a number < 1.0,
  whereas the initial gtksourceviewmm project current version was 1.10.0. To me, version > 1.0 implies
  a certain level of maturity and libgtksourceviewmm is too young to commit on that.
