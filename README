GtkSourceViewMM is a C++ binding of GtkSourceView,
a text widget that extends the standard gtk+ 2.x text widget.
It improves the gtk+ text widget by implementing syntax highlighting
and other features typical of a source editor.

GtkSourceViewMM integrates well in the gtkmm framework and philosophy.
