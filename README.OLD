This package contains a "gtkmm compliant" wrapper for gtksourceview.
At the moment, it only wraps the widget GtkSourceView into
Gtk::SourceView.  The "backend" objects like GtkSourceBuffer,
GtkSourceLanguagesManager etc are still handled through the C interface.
This is not a big problem as the test program will demonstrate.

Gtk::SourceView is a proper decendent of Gtk::TextView and inherits
all the relevant properties and methods.  In addition, it adds 
methods that wrap gtk_source_view_* functions and handles source view
specific signals.

Other aspects of gtksourceview will be wrapped if there's enough demand.

Compiling
---------
The configure script doesn't generate a library. You will simply 
need to copy three files to your project[see note below]
The included configure script will generate Makefiles to make an example
program called testsourceview in the gtksourceviewmm directory.

Requirements to compile:
gtkmm related libraries (glibmm, sigc++)
gtksourceview 1.1.90 or above (older versions may also work)
libxml2 (required by gtksourceview)
gnomeprint stuff (required by gtksourceview. I chose to remove this
requirement in my gtksourceview installation)

and most importantly: 
pkg-config that knows about the libraries listed above.

I have tested with:
gtkmm 2.4.7 glibmm 2.4.5 sigc++ 2.x on linux
gtkmm 2.4.8 glibmm 2.4.x sigc++ 2.x on windows (mingw) with success

Try "pkg-config --list-all" and see if you have all of the above.
If pkg-config doesn't see all the libs, configure script will also
fail to see required libs.

If you think you meet all the dependencies,
./configure
make

(if make succeeds, try out the test app)
cd gtksourceviewmm
./testsourceview

--------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use at the wrapper in your project:

At this time, I chose not to build the wrapper as a separate library and
link in a separate step with the test program, because it's only a
couple of files and it's easier to simply build together with my project.

You can simply copy over sourceview.cpp, sourceview.h, and 
private/sourceview_p.h into your project directory and link it in.

Take a look at main.cpp to see an example.
testsourceview is built from main.cpp and sourceview.cpp
